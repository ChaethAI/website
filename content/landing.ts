We host and manage the AI models ourselves, offering shared or dedicated servers and GPUs based on your workload needs and performance expectations. Scaling is handled automatically to match your usage patterns. Options include VPC peering or Private Link, private subnets with no public egress, and customer‑managed keys (KMS/BYOK) where supported by your provider. Encryption in transit (TLS 1.2+) and at rest (AES‑256) are standard. Controls support PDPA (Thailand) data residency and cross‑border transfer requirements (e.g., defined purposes, consent or other legal basis). Retention policies, in‑country disaster recovery, and detailed audit logs support compliance reviews.",
